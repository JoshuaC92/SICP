Write a process that computes elements of a pascals triangle by means of recursive process.

What is a Pascals triangle, this:

        1
      1   1
    1   2   1
  1   3   3   1
1   4   6   4   1

etc ...

this can be translated to an array like so:

1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,1,4,6,4,1,return

I want to make a function that will return the nth element in that array.

I think this can be done by:

  1. Converting the nth number into an x and y coordinate.
  2. Using those x and y coordinates to calculate the value of that element.

I can see that the rows grow by 1 colum as they increse:

  0   1
  1   2
  2   3
  3   4
  4   5
  etc.
