Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the count-count change procedure of 1.2.2 in making change for 11 cents:

(define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (< amount 0) (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 0)
        (else (+ (cc amount
                     (- kinds-of-coins 1))
                 (cc (- amount
                        (first-denomination
                         kinds-of-coins))
                     kinds-of-coins)))))

(define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 2) 5)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))

I will use only 3 denominations to save space:

                                                    (cc 11 3)
                                              ((cc 11 2)+(cc 1 3))
                                    ((cc 11 1)+(cc 1 2))|((cc 1 2)+(cc -9 3))
              ((cc 11 0)+(cc 10 1))|((cc 1 1)+(cc -4 2))|((cc 1 1)+(cc -4 2))|0
0|((cc 10 0)+(cc ))


What are the orders of growth of space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?

Space: As the process for cc is tree-recursive we can say that the amount of space required for the process will be proportional to the depth of the tree. In other words, it will be a linear amount of space. 

Number of steps: Each time the cc is called, unless either the amont or kinds-of-kinds is <= than 0 it will call itself twice.
